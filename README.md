# Exquisite Shell

A whimsical foray into creative text synthesis, **Exquisite Shell** blends Bash scripting with a sense of literary playfulness. It rummages through a local text database, snips out random lines from cherished authors, and stitches them together—sprinkling in some comedic transformations along the way. Think of it as a cross between a typewriter possessed by a mischievous spirit and a textual DJ, remixing snippets into mini-stories.

## About

This project was inspired by the Surrealist “exquisite corpse” technique, which invites multiple authors (or in this case, lines from different text files) to contribute unpredictable fragments. The script manipulates each borrowed morsel via `sed` and `awk` to slip in a random “snicker” or uppercase flourish, resulting in comedic collisions of style and meaning.

---

## Features

- **Randomized Line Selection:** Pull lines from a curated folder of text files (`./literary_passages/` by default).  
- **Awkward Transformations:** Insert whimsical words, tweak capitalization, or meddle with punctuation.  
- **Configurable Snippet Length:** Choose how many lines to weave into a single “exquisite corpse.”

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Ensure you have a folder named `literary_passages` in the project root.  
3. Populate `literary_passages` with some text files (e.g. quotes, poetry, novel excerpts—whatever delights you).  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/exquisite-shell.git
cd exquisite-shell
mkdir literary_passages
# Add your text files into literary_passages
```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x exquisite_shell.sh
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./exquisite_shell.sh
    ```
    
3. Observe the mini-stories produced in your console, each line lovingly mangled with a dash of comedic artistry.

Curious how you could expand these textual collages further? Perhaps:
- Throw in extra lines and shuffle them with Markov chain logic.
- Insert random references to cryptic mythologies or inside jokes.
- Tweak the script to automatically uppercase or italicize entire lines like an over-enthusiastic poetry slam.

May your forays into textual recombination be wonderfully nonsensical.
